  Abstract                 = {1. __Individual desire__; the plot of __ambition__

The book is set in the context of the scholarly debate between the "traditionalist" - national, collective epic - and "individualist" readings, as well as in that of the historical vs. fictional understanding of the plot. The introduction does a remarkably good job in pres

"Although the singers may have the impression of singing the same song repeatedly, each performance differs, to a greater of lesser degree, from all others on the same theme. Lord, in a recent summary and updating of his theory, points out that the fundamental medium of communication in the oral world is talk, and that song, a form of talk, is a "specially conventionalized medium that serves to filter out some sounds, [and] to amplify others" ("Merging" 19). Through song, images and ideas ". . . are refracted in the mind's eye, an ete that sees _images_ directly rather than through letters and written words." (2-3)

[Yes, a sort of crucial point - the __flux__ capacity, or quality, of the song, of the poem form; the quality of the uninterrupted flow of words that ceaselessly evoke images in the minds of the listeners. Do not forget, then, that aurality might have been the primary form of diffusion of this text - of similar texts; Paolo and Francesca reading Chretien de Troyes together.]

"The work that we will designate in this essay as the _Poema de Mio Cid_ is the Spanish epic par excellence perhaps chiefly because it is the only more or less complete epic manuscript from a medieval Peninsular language to have come down to us. Its uniqueness has prompted one prominent expert on this poem, Colin Smith, to postulate that the work is the unique effort of a solitary poet working in imitation of French epic style." (3)

"The two foci of debate just discussed - historicist/narratological, traditionalist/individualist - are by no means the only dualities to have plagued Cidian criticism. Another such controversy might be called the philology/aestheticism debate." (3)

"It is tempting to view the conflict dramatized in the _PMC_ as one deriving chiefly from the rivalries and confrontations endemic to class struggle. A number of scholars have emphasized the importance of class structure in the work." (5)

"My own exploration of social mentalities in the poem suggests the emergence in the work not of a particular social class but rather of a sensibility of class and the contradictions that derive from it. The poet's understanding of class struggle is inarticulate, corresponding to what some social historians, notably Anthony Giddens, have defined as a phase of imperfect or partial class consciousness." (6)

"For Giddens, a class is not a "bounded social form," nor does it have a "publicly sanctioned identity" or real "membership" (although he admits that complete avoidance of these concepts is difficult). Least of all does a class "act" or "perceive" in the same way as "an individual actor." Classes as a social reality only emerge with "the formation of common patterns of behaviour and attitude." (6)

"The chief symptoms of this intermediate development, argues Giddens, are a denial of the reality of class divisions, and a concomitant accentuation of individual worth and achievement. A willful ignorance of class realtity, as expressed through resolute individualism, thus characterizes the "class awareness of the middle class, in so far as it involves beliefs which place a premium upon individual responsibility and achievement."" (6)

[Individual and collective - the organic status - the organic stage of the formation of a class consciousness/conscience.]

"In the midst of a disavowal of class that paradoxically characterizes nascent class structure, we encounter, therefore, an obsession - presumably unconscious - with rivalry as a function of status emulation." (7)

"All notions of positive social mobility are based, in other words, on the imitation of hated role models. The idiom of ambition is learned from the elite, insuring that the outsider in search of acceptance is determined, willy-nilly, to become what he most hates." (8)

[Start thinking about _gaze_ as a possible form of desire, and therefore of emulation; the sharing of sight - of gaze - as the first step towards emulation, assimilation of the wishes and the values possessed by the upper class.]

"In medieval Spanish literature, the _PMC_ offers a clear contrast to such ramblings in its use of desire as an engine of narrativity. The hero is nothing if not purposeful, focused, desirous. This conqueror of cities, this vanquisher of armies, this humiliator of _malos mestureros_ and dastardly sons-in-law, is above all an ambitious man who gets what he wants. The plot of the poem is the realization of his ambitions." (9)

[PMC being, as usual, a poem about yourself; PMC being a poem about everyman.]

"Without commiting the anachronism - or the cultural incongruity - of viewing him as "bourgeois," we may yet point out the degree to which he resembles the "plotted" heroes of a literary tradition such as the nineteenth-century novel, characterized by Brooks as one that takes seriously (rather than parodically or satirically) the notions of "aspiration," of "getting ahead. For nineteenth-century narrative, argues Brooks, ambition becomes "the vehicle and emblem of Eros, that which totalizes the world as possession and progress." Ambition impels to action, "drives the protagonist forward," until the action is resolved through achievement or renunciation." (9)

[This is how Dante Liano described modernity. This is also the core of Amor en los tiempos del colera.]

"I have argued elsewhere that the economic mentalities of the poetic Cid, involving economic predation and redistribution, and traditional kinship, amity, solidarity, and reciprocity, are precapitalist and charismatic, and therefore quite the contrary of "bourgeois" in the Marxist sense." (10)

"Focused on kin-minded posterity rather than the egotistical here-and-now, he seeks and attains the foundation of a dynasty of his own, as reflected in the climatic lines: "Oy los rreyes d'España sos parientes son, / a todos alcança ondra por el que en buen ora naçió" (3724-25)." (10)

"The discussion that follows is designed to demonstrate the imperative need to consider social topics in the reading of epic." (13)

"The goal, in essence, is modest: to outline a social reading of the poem." (13)

2. __Kinship__ (linaje)

"Kinship is, in general terms, the network of relationship determined by consanguineal links and by associations through marriage." (17)

"European kinship, it is generally agreed, was once organized - to a greater or lesser degree, and with wide regional variations - around descent." (17)

"The _Partidas_, to take a historically significant Peninsular example, present an ego-centered, bilateral catalogue of kinship terms in the Isidorean style." (18)

[I believe we should focus a lot on this notion of ego-centrism - on this ego-centered organization of kinship. Remember that __sight__ is subjectivitiy; it is the essence of subjectivity, the knowing that my point of view is only my point of view.]

"The _PMC_ is constructed around the contrast between these two modes: descent and kinship. Although we will frequently have occasion to remark upon what must be described as the work's primitivism or conservatism, kinship is expressed by means of modern ego-centered terminology." (19)

"Kinship in the _PMC_ is ego-centered in the sense that the hero is the focus of an active group of kinsmen and followers. As we will see presently, this pattern, typical of traditional societies, involves the formation of so-called kindreds by incorporation of both relatives and fictive kinsmen." (20)

"Kinship proper, we have seen, centers on an ego (as in medieval charts of the consanguineal degrees), while descent attributes genealogical affiliation to groups of persons. Each person in the ego-centered system becomes the nucleus of a "system of social relations." There are, in theory, as many such systems as there are persons in a society." (21)

"The Cid's followers constitute a group formed about an individual leader; they are, in their inner circle, recruited from the network of kindreds to which the recruiting individual belongs." (27)

[The value of __recruitment__.]

"The collective sense of unity among the Cid's men - the "common estate and purpose," in Freeman's expression - derives from the vassalic bond that links the Cid's men to their lord: "vassallos tan buenos por coraçon lo an,/mandado de so señor todo lo han a far" (430-31). (28)

"While assigning great importance to the vassalic bond, the _PMC_ emphasizes kinship as the basic associative principle, with vassalage understood as a kind of fictive kinship." (28)

[The rest of the chapter focuses on different forms of kinship, thoroughly analyzed from a historical, even anthropological perspective. Not really relevant.]

"The Cid's primary goal is not merely the acquisition of wealth and power - these are but the scaffolding of his real project - but rather the establishment of a claim to agnatic legitimacy." (45)

"It is natural that the Cid take as model in his genealogical project the lineage of his rivals, for the Cid wants what the Infantes have: a lineage perpetuated diachronically. Emulation thus confirms rivalry: the cognomen, indicator par excellence of the stable, geographically localized, diachronically perpetuated lineage, is an emblem of patrilinear prestige." (50)},

  Abstract                 = {1. __Initiation__

[Myth of initiation as a sort of archetype - Odysseus in the Trojan Horse and under the sheep being the same; system of analogies. _Ritual language_ and the implied _myth_. _Ritual language_ having roots in illiterate societies - in oral transmission and composition; underlying oral, ritual narratives, predating the actual _PMC_.]

[An odd purpose: to use Irish myth as a prototype for Spanish (and continental) narratives.]

[A useful summary of the main episodes in an initiation narrative:]

"As seen in the preceding texts, these incidents are the first battle, the nap, the subduing of the fierce animal by the power of the hero's eyes, the bath or immersion, with some reference to nudity, and the subsequent confrontation with and abuse of women and their garments." (42) 

"Remarkably, however, all the principle traits are to be found in the _Poema del Cid_. The great difference is that the initiation is a failure and its functions are reversed in order and effect. Some actions are displaced to nonheroic figures. Reversals and displacements, which have been identified in the foregoing discussion as classic mechanisms employed in each text for the purpose of manipulating the traditional material, here reach a peak of creativity." (42)

"The abrupt and seemingly offhand introduction of "el león" (2222) into the scene suggests, not a routine occurrence, but one acceptable to the audience, needing no explanation or justification, probably an independent, preexisting narrative motif recognized as appropriate for the mythologizing of heroes. Here the hero is of course not one or both of the presumptive initiands, but the Cid, reaffirmed as the established warrior when he dominates the lion by his presence." (42-43)

"The poem does not specifically attribute the Cid's power over the beast to his eyes. But when animals, like people, look at each other, it is usually eye to eye. Leo Spitzer noted the hypnotic effect of the Cid's presence, referring to "cette sorte d'hypnotisme qu'il exerce sur la bête qui de furieuse devient honteuse" (1938, 529). The Cid's power is surely concentrated in his eyes: "El león, quando lo vio -assí envergonçó, / ante Mio Çid la cabeça premió - e el rostro fincó" [The lion, when he saw him, was so shamefaced, before the Cid he bowed his head and lowered his muzzle] (2298-99)" (43)

"The special quality of the Cid's look, though apparently taken tacitly as general knowledge in this episode, does reappear, and receives considerable attention, in the part of the _PCG_ that continues the Cid's literary biography after the point where the _Poema del Cid_ ends (see note 3). Moors visiting from other lands are prone to comment on the stunning effect of his look: "Vi yo muchas uexes, quando vinien a el mandaeros de moros, se parauan antel fincan commo desbaharecidos catandol, tan grant miedo an de la su catadura" (_PCG_ 2:629b24-28, also 42-45)" (43)

"The poem makes it clear that the Infantes failed to complete the passage from self-centered infantilism to an adult devotion to family and nation, since they married before being initiated as warriors, and for the wrong reason, to enrich themselves rather than to protect and serve their wives." (50)

"The extreme irrationality of the Infantes' act, which has puzzled critics and has seemed a weakness in the poem, gains in authenticity when seen within the pattern of violence against women and the broader scheme of the initiation. These patterns are surely not the only forces that shape the episode, but they are perhaps the most primitive and the basic guide determining the course of action." (52)

[A useful "Listing of Narrative Elements" is on page 81.]

2. Ideas on style - or __Poetics__

[Main thesis: the style used by the narrator (third person exposition of the facts) is different from the style used by the characters (first person speeches).]

"The distinction between the two linguistic registers highlights the contrast between the narrator as performer before an audience and the narrator as the director of the interaction among the poem's characters. His control of both groups, the audience and the fictional characters, is a key to the power and the immediacy of the work. It is his presence among the two groups that brings them together." (91)

"Knowledge exists by being communicated, and in the epic the form of communication is the narrative. The story of the Cid is about a man acting in his society. Neither he nor his poet are men of ideas in a modern sense. The _Cid_ departs from tradition, however, in literary developments such as the elaboration of individual wills and motives, the subtleties of interaction among personages, with attendant ironies, or the conversion of the Cid and others into accomplished declaimers, assimilated in this sense to the author or performer himself. Such departures from an inherited model or matrix are artistically successful: the poem is a transitional work." (92)

"In the poem politeness also serves as the basis of a dynamic through which the presenter reaches out to his audience. The mechanism is comparable to that of a formal introduction of two people who have not met before: here the narrator presents the person who will speak, who then addresses a third party by name. Each of the two speakers uses a line of poetry comprising predetermined though variable patterns of syntax and content. The second of the two lines, in which the speaker addresses his hearer within the poem, is the locus of most of the work's epithetic language." (93)

"The first line of the introduction, which is delivered by the narrating voice, is normally structured as follows: identification (usually by name) of the speaking subject, with an optional epithet or grammatical complement, and a verb. As a variation, the speaking subject may be named in a previous line." (93)},
