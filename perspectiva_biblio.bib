  Abstract                 = {1. __Individual desire__; the plot of __ambition__ The book is set in the context of the scholarly debate between the "traditionalist" - national, collective epic - and "individualist" readings, as well as in that of the historical vs. fictional understanding of the plot. The introduction does a remarkably good job in pres "Although the singers may have the impression of singing the same song repeatedly, each performance differs, to a greater of lesser degree, from all others on the same theme. Lord, in a recent summary and updating of his theory, points out that the fundamental medium of communication in the oral world is talk, and that song, a form of talk, is a "specially conventionalized medium that serves to filter out some sounds, [and] to amplify others" ("Merging" 19). Through song, images and ideas ". . . are refracted in the mind's eye, an ete that sees _images_ directly rather than through letters and written words." (2-3) [Yes, a sort of crucial point - the __flux__ capacity, or quality, of the song, of the poem form; the quality of the uninterrupted flow of words that ceaselessly evoke images in the minds of the listeners. Do not forget, then, that aurality might have been the primary form of diffusion of this text - of similar texts; Paolo and Francesca reading Chretien de Troyes together.] "The work that we will designate in this essay as the _Poema de Mio Cid_ is the Spanish epic par excellence perhaps chiefly because it is the only more or less complete epic manuscript from a medieval Peninsular language to have come down to us. Its uniqueness has prompted one prominent expert on this poem, Colin Smith, to postulate that the work is the unique effort of a solitary poet working in imitation of French epic style." (3) "The two foci of debate just discussed - historicist/narratological, traditionalist/individualist - are by no means the only dualities to have plagued Cidian criticism. Another such controversy might be called the philology/aestheticism debate." (3) "It is tempting to view the conflict dramatized in the _PMC_ as one deriving chiefly from the rivalries and confrontations endemic to class struggle. A number of scholars have emphasized the importance of class structure in the work." (5) "My own exploration of social mentalities in the poem suggests the emergence in the work not of a particular social class but rather of a sensibility of class and the contradictions that derive from it. The poet's understanding of class struggle is inarticulate, corresponding to what some social historians, notably Anthony Giddens, have defined as a phase of imperfect or partial class consciousness." (6) "For Giddens, a class is not a "bounded social form," nor does it have a "publicly sanctioned identity" or real "membership" (although he admits that complete avoidance of these concepts is difficult). Least of all does a class "act" or "perceive" in the same way as "an individual actor." Classes as a social reality only emerge with "the formation of common patterns of behaviour and attitude." (6) "The chief symptoms of this intermediate development, argues Giddens, are a denial of the reality of class divisions, and a concomitant accentuation of individual worth and achievement. A willful ignorance of class realtity, as expressed through resolute individualism, thus characterizes the "class awareness of the middle class, in so far as it involves beliefs which place a premium upon individual responsibility and achievement."" (6) [Individual and collective - the organic status - the organic stage of the formation of a class consciousness/conscience.] "In the midst of a disavowal of class that paradoxically characterizes nascent class structure, we encounter, therefore, an obsession - presumably unconscious - with rivalry as a function of status emulation." (7) "All notions of positive social mobility are based, in other words, on the imitation of hated role models. The idiom of ambition is learned from the elite, insuring that the outsider in search of acceptance is determined, willy-nilly, to become what he most hates." (8) [Start thinking about _gaze_ as a possible form of desire, and therefore of emulation; the sharing of sight - of gaze - as the first step towards emulation, assimilation of the wishes and the values possessed by the upper class.] "In medieval Spanish literature, the _PMC_ offers a clear contrast to such ramblings in its use of desire as an engine of narrativity. The hero is nothing if not purposeful, focused, desirous. This conqueror of cities, this vanquisher of armies, this humiliator of _malos mestureros_ and dastardly sons-in-law, is above all an ambitious man who gets what he wants. The plot of the poem is the realization of his ambitions." (9) [PMC being, as usual, a poem about yourself; PMC being a poem about everyman.] "Without commiting the anachronism - or the cultural incongruity - of viewing him as "bourgeois," we may yet point out the degree to which he resembles the "plotted" heroes of a literary tradition such as the nineteenth-century novel, characterized by Brooks as one that takes seriously (rather than parodically or satirically) the notions of "aspiration," of "getting ahead. For nineteenth-century narrative, argues Brooks, ambition becomes "the vehicle and emblem of Eros, that which totalizes the world as possession and progress." Ambition impels to action, "drives the protagonist forward," until the action is resolved through achievement or renunciation." (9) [This is how Dante Liano described modernity. This is also the core of Amor en los tiempos del colera.] "I have argued elsewhere that the economic mentalities of the poetic Cid, involving economic predation and redistribution, and traditional kinship, amity, solidarity, and reciprocity, are precapitalist and charismatic, and therefore quite the contrary of "bourgeois" in the Marxist sense." (10) "Focused on kin-minded posterity rather than the egotistical here-and-now, he seeks and attains the foundation of a dynasty of his own, as reflected in the climatic lines: "Oy los rreyes d'España sos parientes son, / a todos alcança ondra por el que en buen ora naçió" (3724-25)." (10) "The discussion that follows is designed to demonstrate the imperative need to consider social topics in the reading of epic." (13) "The goal, in essence, is modest: to outline a social reading of the poem." (13) 2. __Kinship__ (linaje) "Kinship is, in general terms, the network of relationship determined by consanguineal links and by associations through marriage." (17) "European kinship, it is generally agreed, was once organized - to a greater or lesser degree, and with wide regional variations - around descent." (17) "The _Partidas_, to take a historically significant Peninsular example, present an ego-centered, bilateral catalogue of kinship terms in the Isidorean style." (18) [I believe we should focus a lot on this notion of ego-centrism - on this ego-centered organization of kinship. Remember that __sight__ is subjectivitiy; it is the essence of subjectivity, the knowing that my point of view is only my point of view.] "The _PMC_ is constructed around the contrast between these two modes: descent and kinship. Although we will frequently have occasion to remark upon what must be described as the work's primitivism or conservatism, kinship is expressed by means of modern ego-centered terminology." (19) "Kinship in the _PMC_ is ego-centered in the sense that the hero is the focus of an active group of kinsmen and followers. As we will see presently, this pattern, typical of traditional societies, involves the formation of so-called kindreds by incorporation of both relatives and fictive kinsmen." (20) "Kinship proper, we have seen, centers on an ego (as in medieval charts of the consanguineal degrees), while descent attributes genealogical affiliation to groups of persons. Each person in the ego-centered system becomes the nucleus of a "system of social relations." There are, in theory, as many such systems as there are persons in a society." (21) "The Cid's followers constitute a group formed about an individual leader; they are, in their inner circle, recruited from the network of kindreds to which the recruiting individual belongs." (27) [The value of __recruitment__.] "The collective sense of unity among the Cid's men - the "common estate and purpose," in Freeman's expression - derives from the vassalic bond that links the Cid's men to their lord: "vassallos tan buenos por coraçon lo an,/mandado de so señor todo lo han a far" (430-31). (28) "While assigning great importance to the vassalic bond, the _PMC_ emphasizes kinship as the basic associative principle, with vassalage understood as a kind of fictive kinship." (28) [The rest of the chapter focuses on different forms of kinship, thoroughly analyzed from a historical, even anthropological perspective. Not really relevant.] "The Cid's primary goal is not merely the acquisition of wealth and power - these are but the scaffolding of his real project - but rather the establishment of a claim to agnatic legitimacy." (45) "It is natural that the Cid take as model in his genealogical project the lineage of his rivals, for the Cid wants what the Infantes have: a lineage perpetuated diachronically. Emulation thus confirms rivalry: the cognomen, indicator par excellence of the stable, geographically localized, diachronically perpetuated lineage, is an emblem of patrilinear prestige." (50)},

Just seeing him from a distance terrifies the Trojans to such an extent that they not only retreat, but in the confusion some fall victim to their own weapons." (2-3) "Achilles’ gaze also follows more than one epic pattern: the blazing of the angry hero, whose gaze can form an assaultive weapon; the mourning of the concerned watcher who laments the deaths of their loved ones." (3) "He is his own audience, looking at himself and listening to the sounds he generates. But he is also at the centre of a nest of audiences, like a gladiator or actor on display, watching himself and surrounded by ranks of different watchers. The other fighters are closest, then the nymphs on the ridges, then out to the goddess, and finally to us, the readers. The emotional responses of all these audiences tend to inspire emotion in us: pity from the warriors, and identification with their own children; desire and anxiety from the nymphs; grief from Diana." (5) "If the Iliad and the Odyssey form two contrasting patterns of epic, battle narrative and quest epic, they both produce visual scenarios: the siege, with city looking out against attackers looking in, two armies drawn up in face-to-face confrontation, is a theatre of war; while the journey, whether towards home or away from it, is defined by a stream of new sights, monstrosities and marvels."

  Abstract                 = {1. __Initiation__ [Myth of initiation as a sort of archetype - Odysseus in the Trojan Horse and under the sheep being the same; system of analogies. _Ritual language_ and the implied _myth_. _Ritual language_ having roots in illiterate societies - in oral transmission and composition; underlying oral, ritual narratives, predating the actual _PMC_.] [An odd purpose: to use Irish myth as a prototype for Spanish (and continental) narratives.] [A useful summary of the main episodes in an initiation narrative:] "As seen in the preceding texts, these incidents are the first battle, the nap, the subduing of the fierce animal by the power of the hero's eyes, the bath or immersion, with some reference to nudity, and the subsequent confrontation with and abuse of women and their garments." (42) "Remarkably, however, all the principle traits are to be found in the _Poema del Cid_. The great difference is that the initiation is a failure and its functions are reversed in order and effect. Some actions are displaced to nonheroic figures. Reversals and displacements, which have been identified in the foregoing discussion as classic mechanisms employed in each text for the purpose of manipulating the traditional material, here reach a peak of creativity." (42) "The abrupt and seemingly offhand introduction of "el león" (2222) into the scene suggests, not a routine occurrence, but one acceptable to the audience, needing no explanation or justification, probably an independent, preexisting narrative motif recognized as appropriate for the mythologizing of heroes. Here the hero is of course not one or both of the presumptive initiands, but the Cid, reaffirmed as the established warrior when he dominates the lion by his presence." (42-43) "The poem does not specifically attribute the Cid's power over the beast to his eyes. But when animals, like people, look at each other, it is usually eye to eye. Leo Spitzer noted the hypnotic effect of the Cid's presence, referring to "cette sorte d'hypnotisme qu'il exerce sur la bête qui de furieuse devient honteuse" (1938, 529). The Cid's power is surely concentrated in his eyes: "El león, quando lo vio -assí envergonçó, / ante Mio Çid la cabeça premió - e el rostro fincó" [The lion, when he saw him, was so shamefaced, before the Cid he bowed his head and lowered his muzzle] (2298-99)" (43) "The special quality of the Cid's look, though apparently taken tacitly as general knowledge in this episode, does reappear, and receives considerable attention, in the part of the _PCG_ that continues the Cid's literary biography after the point where the _Poema del Cid_ ends (see note 3). Moors visiting from other lands are prone to comment on the stunning effect of his look: "Vi yo muchas uexes, quando vinien a el mandaeros de moros, se parauan antel fincan commo desbaharecidos catandol, tan grant miedo an de la su catadura" (_PCG_ 2:629b24-28, also 42-45)" (43) "The poem makes it clear that the Infantes failed to complete the passage from self-centered infantilism to an adult devotion to family and nation, since they married before being initiated as warriors, and for the wrong reason, to enrich themselves rather than to protect and serve their wives." (50) "The extreme irrationality of the Infantes' act, which has puzzled critics and has seemed a weakness in the poem, gains in authenticity when seen within the pattern of violence against women and the broader scheme of the initiation. These patterns are surely not the only forces that shape the episode, but they are perhaps the most primitive and the basic guide determining the course of action." (52) [A useful "Listing of Narrative Elements" is on page 81.] 2. Ideas on style - or __Poetics__ [Main thesis: the style used by the narrator (third person exposition of the facts) is different from the style used by the characters (first person speeches).] "The distinction between the two linguistic registers highlights the contrast between the narrator as performer before an audience and the narrator as the director of the interaction among the poem's characters. His control of both groups, the audience and the fictional characters, is a key to the power and the immediacy of the work. It is his presence among the two groups that brings them together." (91) "Knowledge exists by being communicated, and in the epic the form of communication is the narrative. The story of the Cid is about a man acting in his society. Neither he nor his poet are men of ideas in a modern sense. The _Cid_ departs from tradition, however, in literary developments such as the elaboration of individual wills and motives, the subtleties of interaction among personages, with attendant ironies, or the conversion of the Cid and others into accomplished declaimers, assimilated in this sense to the author or performer himself. Such departures from an inherited model or matrix are artistically successful: the poem is a transitional work." (92) "In the poem politeness also serves as the basis of a dynamic through which the presenter reaches out to his audience. The mechanism is comparable to that of a formal introduction of two people who have not met before: here the narrator presents the person who will speak, who then addresses a third party by name. Each of the two speakers uses a line of poetry comprising predetermined though variable patterns of syntax and content. The second of the two lines, in which the speaker addresses his hearer within the poem, is the locus of most of the work's epithetic language." (93) "The first line of the introduction, which is delivered by the narrating voice, is normally structured as follows: identification (usually by name) of the speaking subject, with an optional epithet or grammatical complement, and a verb. As a variation, the speaking subject may be named in a previous line. The second line, which begins his or her speech, names the merspn addressed (this is an essential component of the pattern) and usually applies an epithet to that person. It might be expected that the verb of the first line would be a verb of speaking, a _verbum dicendi_, but this is so in less than half the cases. The most common substitute is (1) a verb of motion. Progressively less frequent alternatives are (2) verbs of ceremonial action and (3) those of feeling or perception. As examples, "se levantó" (3199, etc.) in the law court fits the first two categories, "alegrós" (2442) the third. Dámaso Alonso noted, in his first published commentary on this pattern, in 1944, that the absence of the _verbum dicendi_ in these introductions probably bore a relation to the technique of oral delivery, while for the modern reader it contributes an emotional, dramatic tone to the text (1973b, 116)." (93) "The pattern in skeleton form is: line 1: identification of the subject who is to speak, verb (of motion, etc.), epithet or complement; line 2 (which begins the quotation): the name of the addressee, an epithet." (93) "A further point of contact, which I will discuss later in connection with the poem's metonymic manner, is in the clearly established sense of where each action occurs." (95) "Places are also a basic structural element of the _Poema del Cid_ in their own right." (96) "Exemplifying the normal habit, the dealings with Raquel and Vidas are segmented and organized by six crossings of the river Arlanzón. The law court scene is preceded, and prepared artistically, by arrival in Toledo, relocation to San Servando, and return to the city." (96) "On a larger scale, the beginningf and the end of the Cid's migration are each marked by the viewing of a scene in its significant details - the ruined buildings in Vivar and the lands and sea around Valencia: the Cid's two chief properties, which define his successive stations in life." (96) [97: the characters' hortatory mode; probably not relevant for our purpose, although - it must be admitted - this section of the book is very good.] [Remember that __negation__ will be a substantial part of your work: it will be about the __denial__ of gaze. Therefore, quotations such as this might prove useful:] "The child makes no reference to the transaction she is contucting between the people of Burgos and the herom nor does she state explicitly their feelings of solidarity with him and helplessness in the face of the royal order. When she says, "el rrey lo ha vedado," "lo" needs no expressed antecedent. The absence, on the surface, of these elements in no way interferes with understanding; rather, it confirms the preexisting mutual comprehension and agreement among the various parties, strong enough to make explanation and entreaty superfluous. The Cid's silence (exceptional in the poem, in which requests usually receive answers) again heightens the effect for the audience. The girl is a poetic device, a voice that defeats the enforced silence. Since she is eloquent in her stylized humility, the arfificiality of the device is perfectly acceptable." (99) [More, since this scene is crucial for us too:] "A chief determinant of the language used in this scene is the sense of hierarchy. The child is near the bottom of the social scale, and she speaks for the people of Burgos collectively, as they face with difficulty an appeal for aid from a neighbor more powerful than they." (99) "In the dealings with the moneylenders, the Cid likewise avoids any use of the imperative." (101) [Follows a discussion about the ways of expressing __commands__ that are more indirect than the simple imperative; somehow useful, if we consider the problem of shared responsibility and the creation of a collective perspective through gaze; could _gaze_ be another alternative way of expressing hierarchy and power?] "Gradations are particularly numerous with _querer_: "Enviarvos quiero" (813, and 1271, 1274), "fablar querría" (104, also 538), and phrasing where two forms of thw verb are paired, aptly emphasizing harmony of wills: "Si vós quisiéredes, Minaya,-quiero saber rrecabdo" (1257) and "Mas lo que él quisiere,-esso queramos nós" (1953)" (105) [From this point on, the author's purpose is to link these stylistic devices to the epic traditions, with examples drawn from the _Chanson de Roland_ et alia.] "In the _Cid_, the exhortations and commands are phrased to be most acceptable to the hearer of the poem as well as to the fictional addressee. One system of social intercourse, one code of courtesy, and one set of hierarchies are recognized as valid and as applicable both to those imagined and to those present. The characters vie with one another in speaking well, as the minstrel vies with other minstrels." (111) "The hero's actions, words, and gestures are those of a man perfectly adapted to his station in life, but they are formalized, elevated, stylized-in a word, ritualized." (113) [Beautiful description of the encounter between el Cid and Doña Jimena as one in which the idea of _delay_ is central.] "The phrases "yo lo veo" and "Ya lo vedes" bring out the harmony of perception: "to see" is often "to understand" in the poem, and is so used at other critical moments as well (see pp. 120 and 153)." (115) [The verses discussed are 278-284.] "The repetition and counterbalanced wording, with periodic rhythms of sound, word, and sense, can be even more marked in narrative segments. The actions and movements of the personages are visualized more effectively than in most medieval literature, in a stylized geometry that is synchronized with the flow of the poem's language. The effect would be intensified if the poem were chanted." (116) "A segment in which the linguistic structure takes on an iconic or representational quality, mimicking he skilled disposition of troops in an encampement, encompasses laisse 27" (117) [Laisse 27 is vv. 557-563; __N.B.:__ this Laisse seems __truly__ fruitful; it deserves further analysis and attention.] "The rhythmic patterning, which is continued in to the next laisse, brings out the symmetry and hence the fixity, the "finança" in the final summarizing word, of the Cid's position (one which, paradoxically, he later pretends to abandon in disorder)." (118) [Still the same passage. This intuitiion is __crucial__. Is this the connection? Is this the real __core__ of any observation I could make about __vision__, the fact that there is always _motion_ and _repose_, and that my __knight__ is here __stable__.]},
